# SRH: Serverless Redis HTTP
A redis connection pooler for serverless applications. This allows your serverless functions to talk to Redis via HTTP,
while also not having to worry about the Redis max connection limits.

Totally open source so you still own the data - run it with your own Redis server.

I will also offer some kinda SaaS version when it's a bit more done ;) - but still BYOR (bring your own Redis)!

Don't use this yet - it's still in development.

Also, it's totally compatible with the Upstash Redis Client SDKs.
